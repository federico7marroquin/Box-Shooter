# Box-Shooter

This is my fourth unity game. Here you can see A Tron Aesthetic Shooter called Box Shooter. 

Rules:
You have to shoot to certain boxes in order to win the game before the time is over:
White boxes Give you time.
Green boxes Give you points.
Yellow boxes steal your points and time.
Red boxes Give you points and steal your time.

In the Build folder, you can find and play the game for WebGL and Windows platforms. Enjoy.
